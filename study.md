# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree!
## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.


```md
It is not the view sounce. It is not the html you wrote.
<!-- your answer here -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes it is. It is a visual reperentation of the DOM, which is why there are so many arrows to open/close/expand/collapse which is like the tree.
<!-- your answer here -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
I think the DOM is important because if we watch it carefully and see what it
does, it will tell us what is happening with our code that we wrote and how the
browser is parsing through it. If there are mistakes made in the html, depending
on the mistake the DOM will correct it for us which is a really greate learning
tool.
```
